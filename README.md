# data-structure-and-algo
This repository is all about the data structures and algorithms that are mostly used in coding interview.

# Data Structures
1. Array (Dynamic and Static)
2. Hash Table
3. Linked Lists
  prepend - O(1) => Add a new node at the beginning of the list
  append - O(1) => Add a new node at the end of the list
  lookup - O(n) => We can also call traversal, search an item in the list
  insert - O(n) => Add a new node at the specific index
  delete - O(n) => Delete a node in the list
